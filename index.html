    <p>I am still attending the coding bootcamp, so this box is pretty much empty. The website you are currently visiting is my best example of a site that I have built. This is our first major project in the University of Utah Coding Bootcamp. This site was built entirely with HTML and CSS and no JavaScript. Be sure to check out the website with multiple screen sizes to check out the cross-device functionality, and check back later for more updates.</p>
